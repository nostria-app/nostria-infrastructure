# Nostria Infrastructure

This repository contains infrastructure as code (IaC) for the Nostria Azure environment, using Bicep templates and PowerShell automation scripts.

## Infrastructure Components

- **Linux App Service Plan (B1)**: Hosts all container applications
- **Container Apps**:
  - `discovery.nostria.app`: Discovery service (single instance)
  - `relay[N].nostria.app`: Relay services (multiple instances as needed)
  - `media[N].nostria.app`: Media services (multiple instances as needed)
- **Storage Accounts**:
  - Each service has its own storage account with Azure File Share mounted to the container
  - Each storage account has a corresponding backup storage account

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure PowerShell Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)
- Azure Subscription with appropriate permissions

### Login to Azure

```powershell
# Login to your Azure account
Connect-AzAccount

# Select your subscription if you have multiple
Set-AzContext -SubscriptionId "<your-subscription-id>"
```

## Deployment

### Update Discovery Relays

When a new image of the Discovery Relay is built using the separate repo, run this command to update the web app:

```powershell
 ./scripts/update-web-app.ps1 -WebAppNames @("nostria-discovery-eu") -ResourceGroup "nostria-eu" -ContainerImage "ghcr.io/nostria-app/discovery-relay:9e75597ed5c7ad4e97f5278b35f325ded9465b43"
```

### Deploying the Infrastructure

Use the `deploy.ps1` script to deploy the entire infrastructure:

```powershell
 ./scripts/deploy-main.ps1
 ./scripts/deploy-region.ps1 -Regions eu,af
```

Parameters:
- `ResourceGroupName`: Name of the resource group (default: "nostria")
- `Location`: Azure region (default: "westeurope")
- `RelayCount`: Number of relay instances to create (default: 1)
- `MediaCount`: Number of media instances to create (default: 1)

### Scaling the Infrastructure

To add more relay or media instances, simply update the count parameters:

```powershell
# Add two more relay instances (creating relay2 and relay3)
./scripts/deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "nostria" -RelayCount 3

# Add more media instances
./scripts/deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "nostria" -MediaCount 2
```

## Backup and Restore

```powershell
./scripts/backup.ps1 -WebAppName "nostria-discovery"
./scripts/restore.ps1 -WebAppName "nostria-discovery"
```

### Backing Up a Storage Account

```powershell
# Backup the media1 storage account
./scripts/backup.ps1 -SourceStorageName "nostriamedia1" -ResourceGroupName "nostria"
```

This will copy all files from the source storage account to the backup storage account (nostriamedia1bkp).

### Restoring from Backup

```powershell
# Restore from backup to the media1 storage account
./scripts/restore.ps1 -BackupStorageName "nostriamedia1bkp" -TargetStorageName "nostriamedia1" -ResourceGroupName "nostria"
```

## Nostria Notification

Make sure that the following environment variables are set in the container app:

- `PUBLIC_VAPID_KEY`: Public VAPID key for web push notifications
- `PRIVATE_VAPID_KEY`: Private VAPID key for web push notifications
- `VAPID_SUBJECT`: E-mail for the VAPID
- `NOTIFICATION_API_KEY`: Admin API key for the Nostria Notification service

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for automating the deployment of containers:

- `deploy-discovery.yml`: Builds and deploys the discovery container app when changes are pushed to the `discovery/` directory.

### Setting up GitHub Actions

1. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:
   - `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`: JSON output from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command

## Future Improvements

- Upgrading storage accounts to Premium tier:
  ```powershell
  # Update the sku parameter in the bicep template when deploying
  ./scripts/deploy.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "nostria-we" -StorageSku "Premium_LRS"
  ```

- Adding monitoring and alerting for the infrastructure
- Implementing Key Vault for secrets management
- Setting up traffic manager for load balancing


## Notes

- Web Apps have a principal with access to the storage account.
- Web apps does not have access to the backup storage account.
- This ensures that hacked web apps cannot access the backup storage account.

## Regions

### Planned regions for Nostria

discovery-eu.nostria.app (Europe)   
discovery-us.nostria.app (USA)   
discovery-as.nostria.app (Asia)   
discovery-af.nostria.app (Africa)   
discovery-sa.nostria.app (South America)   
discovery-au.nostria.app (Australia)   
discovery-jp.nostria.app (Japan)   
discovery-cn.nostria.app (China)   
discovery-in.nostria.app (India)   
discovery-me.nostria.app (Middle East)   

We might need to expand with multiple data centers in the same region, perhaps we could either name them with a number (e.g. discovery-eu1.nostria.app, discovery-eu2.nostria.app) or use a different naming convention.

### Data centers for each region

eu: westeurope (Amsterdam, Netherlands)   
us: centralus (Iowa, US)   
as: southeastasia (Singapore)   
af: southafricanorth (Johannesburg, South Africa)   
sa: brazilsouth (SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil)   
au: australiaeast (Sydney, Australia)   
jp: japaneast (Tokyo, Japan)   
cn: chinanorth (Beijing, China) (Special considerations for China, might not be available for us)   
in: centralindia (Pune, India)   
me: uaenorth (Abu Dhabi, UAE)   

### Initial Deployment Schedule Plan

1. Europe - This is our primary region, stateless apps will only be hosted here initially.
2. Africa - This is our first secondary region.
3. US - This is our second secondary region.
4. Asia, we will first deploy in Singapore, which gives OK coverage for the rest of Asia and Australia.
5. South America.

## Developer Notes

How to get the Azure credentials for GitHub Actions:

```powershell
# Get name and id and type:
az ad sp list | ConvertFrom-Json | Where-Object { $_.servicePrincipalType -ne "Application" } | Select-Object displayName, appId, id, servicePrincipalType | Format-Table -AutoSize | Out-File -FilePath './filtered-service-principals.txt'

# Get all details:
az ad sp list | ConvertFrom-Json | Where-Object { $_.servicePrincipalType -ne "Application" } | Out-File -FilePath './filtered-service-principals-all.txt'
```

```powershell	
# Create a service principal with the required permissions
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "nostria-deployment" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id> --sdk-auth > ./github-actions-credentials.json
```

After a lot of issues with mapping volumes to the container, it was discovered that it's not really needed. As long as the apps within the container can take configurations from environment variables, we can set that to /home/data which is then mapped in the setup.

Instead of overriding the volume mapping in the container, we can also map the default paths to the Azure File Share.

nostria-media: /app/data
nostria-status: /app/data
nostria-discovery: app/data
nostria-relay: /app/strfry-db and /etc/strfry.conf
